Animated-Bar-Charts
UIC CS251 Project 3 - Represents categorical data in a simple,  yet powerful bar chart animations.

Please Note:
Unfortunately, C++ graphics are not super compatible with Linux (virtual machines) and C++ programs
are not easily transportable across different operating systems. Therefore, this project is not using 
graphics and will instead be creating a text-based animated bar chart.

Please refer to project pdf.
